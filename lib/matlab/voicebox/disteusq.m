function d=disteusq(x,y,mode,w)
%DISTEUSQ calculate euclidean, squared euclidean or mahanalobis distance D=(X,Y,MODE,W)
%
% Inputs: X,Y         Vector sets to be compared. Each row contains a data vector.
%                     X and Y must have the same number of columns.
%
%         MODE        Character string selecting the following options:
%                         'x'  Calculate the full distance matrix from every row of X to every row of Y
%                         'd'  Calculate only the distance between corresponding rows of X and Y
%                              The default is 'd' if X and Y have the same number of rows otherwise 'x'.
%                         's'  take the square-root of the result to give the euclidean distance.
%
%         W           Optional weighting matrix: the distance calculated is (x-y)*W*(x-y)'
%                     If W is a vector, then the matrix diag(W) is used.
%
% Output: D           If MODE='d' then D is a column vector with the same number of rows as the shorter of X and Y.
%                     If MODE='x' then D is a matrix with the same number of rows as X and the same number of columns as Y'.
