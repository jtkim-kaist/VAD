function [pf,f]=lpcar2pf(ar,np)
%LPCAR2PF Convert AR coefs to power spectrum PF=(AR,NP)
%
%  Inputs: ar(nf,n)     AR coefficients, one frame per row
%          np           Size of output spectrum is np+1 [n]
%
% Outputs: pf(nf,np+1)  Power spectrum from DC to Nyquist
%          f(1,np+1)    Normalized frequencies (0 to 0.5)
%
% For high speed make np equal to a power of 2
